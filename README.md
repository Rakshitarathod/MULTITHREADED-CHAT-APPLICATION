# Multithreaded Chat Application

## Overview
A Java-based real-time chat application that supports multiple clients with both broadcast and selective messaging capabilities. Built using Java Swing for the GUI and Java Sockets for networking.

- **Server-side:**
  - Handles multiple client connections
  - Username validation
  - Real-time user tracking
  - Message broadcasting
  - Selective messaging (multicast)
  - Disconnection notifications

- **Client-side:**
  - User registration
  - Message broadcasting
  - Selective messaging
  - Active user list
  - Clean disconnect

## Technical Details
- **Language:** Java
- **GUI:** Swing
- **Networking:** Java Sockets
- **Concurrency:** Multithreading
- **Data Structures:** ConcurrentHashMap, HashSet

## Installation & Usage

### Requirements
- Java JDK 8+


## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

### 1. Server Side:
- `Server.java` starts a socket server on a fixed port.
- For each client connection, a new thread (`ClientHandler`) is created.
- Server broadcasts incoming messages to all connected clients.

### 2. Client Side:
- `Client.java` connects to the server using socket.
- Two threads are used:
  - One for sending user input to the server.
  - One for reading messages from the server.

## üöÄ How to Run
- ServerView.java - It contains code for server. This class must be run first.
- loginClient.java - It contains code for client's login and run after the server has been started. It can be run as many number of times depending upon number of clients required.
- ClientView.java - It contains code for the client.

1. **Start the Server**
   ```bash
   java server.Server
   ```

2. **Start Clients (in separate terminals)**
   ```bash
   java client.Client
   ```

3. Type messages and chat in real time!
